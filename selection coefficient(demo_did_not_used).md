## Analysis of ideas

### Criteria and their coefficient

* Market
	* Number of competitors(Nc) nc= 0.1
	* Competitive ability(C) bases on google search requests statistic and website traffic of competitors.
	(Copetitive ability is grade of competitors)c= 0.7
	* Product demand(Pd) bases on google search requests statistics
	pd= 0.9

* Subjective(command grade)
	* Time spent(T)
	t= 0.5
	* Support costs(SC)
	sc = 0.3
	* Originality(O)
	o= 0.6
	* Complexity of implementation(Ð¡I)
	ci= 0.3
	* The ability to write good code(A)(The ability to surprise curators)
	a= 0.9

### Formula
Based on the goals of the project, the most significant criteria were selected A, Pd, C, O.

Nc, C, T, Sc, CI - reduce the criterion for choosing an idea

Pd, O, A.

CH = (Pd*pd + O*o + A*a - SC*sc - CI*ci -C*c)/(nc*Nc + T*t)
